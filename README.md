## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (latest LTS recommended)
- npm or yarn

### Development

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd claude-code-ui
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
Create a `.env` file in the project root with your configuration.

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

This runs both the backend (port 3001) and frontend (port 3000) concurrently.

### Production Deployment

1. Build the application:
```bash
npm run build
```

2. Start the production server:
```bash
npm start
```

The production server runs on port 8000 and is managed by PM2.

### Production Management

The application uses PM2 for process management in production:

```bash
# Restart the application
pm2 restart claude-code-ui

# View logs
pm2 logs claude-code-ui

# List running processes
pm2 list

# Quick redeploy (build + restart)
npm run build && npm start
```
